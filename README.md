# byod (bring your own data)

## What you'll bring
Data, specifically, multivariate time series data. The data can come from anywhere: neuron responses, wearable sensors, climate financial records, user clicks, EEG channels. They just need to be time series. Standard input formats will be defined ahead of time for both small data sets (for local computing) and large distributed data, and all data will be hosted and made available on a public Amazon S3 bucket.

## What you'll do
Use open-source analysis and visualization tools to create the most interesting and revealing representations of your data. Work on your own, or in groups, on either your data, or someone else's.
