# byod (bring your own data)

# What you'll bring
Data, specifically, time series data. The data itself can be anything, from any data source. Neuron responses, wearable sensors, climate financial records, user clicks, EEG channels. They just need to be time series. Input formats will be defined ahead of time for both small data sets and large distributed data, and all data will be hosted on a public Amazon S3 bucket.

# What you'll do
Use open-source analysis and visualization tools to create the most interesting and revealing representations of your data. Work on your own, or in groups, on either your data, or someone else's.
